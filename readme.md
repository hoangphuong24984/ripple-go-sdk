func (suite *RippleTestSuite) TestTransfer() {

	rippleClient := NewXRPLClient(true)

	fromAddress := "rJqqJzpivdmRwHQ5a3t3WbizJHjQrZYtG6"
	fromPrivateKey := "..."

	toAddress := "rHNvvvUCJpnJJbbvHaW5EBMP5dhQmieKEv"

	amount := big.NewInt(1 * 1e6)
	tx, err := rippleClient.Transfer(fromPrivateKey, fromAddress, toAddress, amount)

	fmt.Println("tx, err: ", tx, err)
}
```
